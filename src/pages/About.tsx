              Our Story
            </h2>
            <p className="text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed">
              TLDRify was born from the frustration of spending hours consuming content that could be 
              summarized in minutes. In today's information-overloaded world, we believe that 
              understanding the essence of content quickly is not just a luxuryâ€”it's a necessity.
